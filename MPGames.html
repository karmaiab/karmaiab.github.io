                    Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. 
                    The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), 
                    which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. 
                    Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. 
                    Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, 
                    known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. 
                    During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. 
                    A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.
